## Example: Implementing Auto ARIMA in R

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to implement Auto ARIMA in R using the `forecast` package:

```R
# Load the AirPassengers dataset (built-in dataset in R)
data <- AirPassengers

# Visualize the time series data
plot(data, main="Air Passengers Time Series", ylab="Number of Passengers")

# Apply Auto ARIMA
fit <- auto.arima(data)

# Print the model summary
summary(fit)

# Generate forecasts for the next 10 periods
forecasts <- forecast(fit, h=10)

# Plot the forecasts
plot(forecasts, main="Air Passengers Forecasts", ylab="Number of Passengers")
```

This example showcases how easy it is to use the `auto.arima()` function to automatically identify the best ARIMA model for a time series dataset. The function handles the model selection process for you, saving you time and effort.
